# CodeAlpha_Task
This repository contains the frontend web development projects and tasks completed during my internship at Code Alpha. It includes responsive web designs, interactive user interfaces, and implementations of modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks. The purpose is to showcase my learning progress, skills, and hands-on experience.
